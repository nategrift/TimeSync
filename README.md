# TimeSync 

A basic watch with hopes to be a more advanced smart watch with time.

### Goals

- Use the ESP-IDF framework (Instead of Ardunio)
- Create a watch that pairs to the phone, allowing for various syncing (time, notifications, etc.)
- Use the FreeRTOS operating system for easier handling and more fine tuning control

### How to Run

- Current hardware I am using is the ESP-32-WROVER
- I am using PlatformIO to upload the firemare to the device
